<p>Typography and font choices play a crucial role in the overall effectiveness of a project, particularly on websites. 
  Text is often the most direct way to communicate with visitors, and legibility should always be a top priority. A 
  well-chosen typeface can enhance the user experience, but if text is difficult to read, it detracts from the message 
  you're trying to convey.</p>
<p>For example, the Yale School of Art website <em>(see screenshot below)</em> features a busy static background, and the text does not stand out enough 
against it. This lack of contrast makes reading the content challenging. While the use of headings does help to break up the 
sections, the text could benefit from greater contrast or even some design adjustments like text shadowing or background overlays 
to improve readability.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the typography used on the Tapioca website <em>(see screenshot below)</em> is a great example of effective design. The bold, clean 
typeface is not only visually striking but also very legible. Its simplicity makes it easy to read, while its strong presence 
draws attention, striking a balance between functionality and aesthetics.</p> 
<p>In both cases, the key takeaway is that the right typography can significantly impact how users interact with your website or project.</p>
