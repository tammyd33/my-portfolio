<p>For this project I chose to create a series of social media ads. <br>
  I am not a social media person, so I chose this project to branch 
  out from my normal design interests. <br>
  These ads are for a dog walker in the city so I started with a cityscape 
  image for the background. I added a gradient map to give it a duo-tone 
  effect. I chose this effect so I can tie all of the ads together with 
  the same style. The simple, flat drawing of the dogs are an eye catching 
  image that I thought should be prominent to draw attention. The sunglasses 
  are copied in as a shape. Using a selection of the highlights on the 
  glasses shape, I added a blank layer and using a brush, filled in with 
  white (I had some trouble, see explanation below). After adding the glasses, 
  I decided to fill in the transparent areas in the dog’s face to help it 
  stand out. I added a blank layer behind the dog layer and used the brush 
  tool. I used a color fill layer style on those painted layers to adjust the 
  colors on each ad to better match the background. On the Golden Retriever 
  & Collie ads, I used the perspective transform tool to adjust the sunglasses 
  to the angle of the dog’s face. After adding all of the text, I decided to 
  add a rectangle behind the discount info so it could be identified as a button 
  to be linked to the website in the future. The social media icons were vectors 
  that I pasted in as shapes but I want the logos to be transparent, so I masked 
  out the logos from the circles and changed the circle color to stand out on each ad.</p>
