<p>Magazine Cover</p>
<img src="../assets/magazine_cover.jpg" alt="magazine" height="450" width="337">
<p>For this project I chose to create a magazine cover. 
  The different fonts and the way they are layered with the 
  photos and images on magazines has always sparked my 
  interest, so this project choice was easy. <br>
  Since the theme for my magazine is art & graphic design, 
  the image I chose for the cover featured an artist next to 
  a framed piece of art. The art in the frame was a bit too 
  subtle for my vision, so I used the skew transform tool and 
  added some filters to replace the image. I felt like the empty 
  space next to the artist was taking away from the subject of 
  my main article so I enlarged the photo to fill up the page 
  better, but that left a gap on the right side of the document. 
  Using generative fill, I was able to extend the photo to fill 
  the gap nicely. I wanted a bit of dimension so I masked out a 
  small part of the a and r in the title to make it appear to be 
  behind the artist. The barcode was created using a free online 
  barcode generator and downloaded as a GIF. I wanted the barcode 
  to match the text color so I masked out the white background and 
  added a color layer style.
