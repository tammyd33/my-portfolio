<p>Cycling Infographic</p>
<img src="../assets/cycling_infographic.gif" alt="project 2" height="400" width="400">
  <p>This project is an animated infographic on the benefits of cycling. <br>
    When I was searching for an illustration to use, this one caught my 
    attention because of all of the pieces that could be animated. <br>
    I watched a tutorial that showed how to use a motion tween to rotate 
    objects and was excited to try that on the wheels and triangle arrows. 
    Classic tweens were used to animate the heart, plant, and water drop. 
    The landscape and road were moved using a motion tween. <br>
    I attempted to move a small circle left to right along the line in 
    the heart symbol but was unsuccessful, so the heart just beats. I was 
    also unsuccessful at moving the legs and pedals to ride the bike.
