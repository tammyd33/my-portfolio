<p>Magazine Cover</p>
<img src="../assets/magazine_cover.jpg" alt="magazine" height="450" width="337">
<p>For this project I chose to create a magazine cover. <br>
  The different fonts and the way they are layered with the <br>
  photos and images on magazines has always sparked my <br>
  interest, so this project choice was easy. <br>
  Since the theme for my magazine is art & graphic design, <br>
  the image I chose for the  cover featured an artist next to <br>
  a framed piece of art. The art in the frame was a bit too <br>
  subtle for my vision, so I used the skew transform tool and <br>
  added some filters to replace the image. I felt like the empty <br>
  space next to the artist was taking away from the subject of <br>
  my main article so I enlarged the photo to fill up the page <br>
  better, but that left a gap on the right side of the document. <br>
  Using generative fill, I was able to extend the photo to fill <br>
  the gap nicely. I wanted a bit of dimension so I masked out a <br>
  small part of the a and r in the title to make it appear to be <br>
  behind the artist. The barcode was created using a free online <br>
  barcode generator and downloaded as a GIF. I wanted the barcode <br>
  to match the text color so I masked out the white background and <br>
  added a color layer style.
